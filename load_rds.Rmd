```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

The [load_rds.R](https://github.com/davemargraf/load_file_scripts/blob/master/load_rds.R) script will load all the RDS files saved in a `/rds` subdirectory of an *R* project to the project environment.


First, it stores the project working directory.
```{r}
wd <- getwd()
```

Then, appends `/rds` subdirectory name. 
```{r}
filedir <- paste0(wd,"/rds")
```

Next, create a list of file names.
```{r}
files <- list.files(filedir)
```

The code below will move to the `/rds` subdirectory, apply the `readRDS()` function to file list, then return to the project working directory.

```{r}
setwd(filedir)
lapply(files, readRDS)
setwd(wd)
```

<!-- Alternatively, we can read the rds files from the project directory with this method -->
